# Meet Julia, a new programming language for data science

Friday October 25, 2019 from 3:00pm-5:00pm

CHIPS Room 208
[Add street address and directions?]

Are you a budding data scientist curious about new programming
language?  Do you wish you could speed up your R or Python program?
Have you heard of Julia but didn't know how to get started?

The Biostatistics Division of the Department of Preventive Medicine at
UTHSC will be hosting a 2-hour introduction/tutorial session on the
Julia programming language.

Julia is a new interactive open-source programming language that
combines the functionality of quantitative environments such as R and
Python with the speed of production programming languages like Java
and C/C++ to solve big data and analytics problems.

The tutorial will introduce Julia to attendees. After installing Julia
on your laptop (all operating systems are welcome!) we will give
live demos of what Julia can do and what it is good for.

Users of all ability levels are welcome.  Donâ€™t forget to bring your
laptop! Refreshments will be served.
