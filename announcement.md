Meet Julia
Friday October 25, 2019 from 3:00pm-5:00pm

CHIPS Room 208

Have you met Julia, the MIT-created programming language?

The Julia Computing company describes her as an open-source
programming language that "combines the functionality of quantitative
environments such as R and Python with the speed of production
programming languages like Java and C++ to solve big data and
analytics problems."

The Biostatistics Division of the Preventive Medicine Department will
be hosting a 2-hour introduction/tutorial session on the Julia
programming language.

The objective of the session is to familiarize yourself with this
relatively new programming language: After installing Julia on your
laptop (all OS are welcome!) and providing a quick introduction of
what Julia can do, examples of the Julia environment and code will be
shown.

Julia is an interactive language that works with Python and R, so if
you've never heard about her, please join us, and donâ€™t forget to
bring your laptop! Light snacks will be served.
